        otherwise EXIT(None, None, None).

        EXIT is removed from the stack, leaving the values above it in
        the same order. In addition, if the stack represents an
        exception, and the function call returns a  true  value, this
        information is  zapped , to prevent END_FINALLY from
        re-raising the exception. (But non-local gotos should still be
